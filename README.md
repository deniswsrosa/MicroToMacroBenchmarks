# From micro to MACRO Benchmarks

This repository contains the code and slides of the talk "From micro to MACRO Benchmarks".
OBS: Both the slides and Demos are still work in progress

## Slides

Clone the repository and open the file slides/index.html on your browser.

## Java Classes

The Java classes are implemented during the talk, so I'm sorry for the small mess there, I will properly adjust the classes later.
